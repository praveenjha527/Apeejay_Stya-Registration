# Apeejay_Stya-Registration
Official repository of Apeejay Stya University Registration Module.

The purpose of this project is to develop a working model of a software for course registration process in a university. The idea is to simplify the process of opting for courses by providing a common platform where students, teachers and administration can interact and choose required courses, without the hassle of running around or dealing with time table clashes at a later stage.



1.1 Statement of Objective
1.1.1 Problem statement
The purpose of this project is to develop a working model of a software for course registration process in a university. We do not have an online registration process for students which makes registration for students a bit confusing. The offline process is time consuming. Also, there are some technical glitches in the registration system with clashing of various courses in the timetable.
1.1.2 Objective statement
The idea is to simplify the process of opting for courses by providing a common platform where students, teachers and administration can interact and choose required courses, without the hassle of running around or dealing with time table clashes at a later stage.
1.1.3 Significance of the study
This will help us to achieve an efficient online registration system for a student from any stream without any inconvenience of clashing of timetable. Through this process the student will get to know the courses which they can take and teachers and administration will have precise information of subjects students have opted for.
